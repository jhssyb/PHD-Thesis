\section*{Abstract}

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) encompass a large palette of statistical tools allowing to assess uncertainties in a system.

The purpose of this work is to propose some directions of improvement on various methodological aspects of Uncertainty Quantification applied to costly numerical environments. The methods developed can be used in various fields and are demonstrated through multiple applications. Moreover, these methods are not limited to the use of numerical experiments and can be used equally for \emph{in vivo} experiments.

The capabilities of the novel methods are demonstrated on realistic engineering systems using CFD tools.


\textbf{Keywords:} Uncertainty Quantification, Design of Experiments, high dimensions, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Large Eddy Simulation
